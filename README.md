## üìÑ Paper Summary

This paper introduces the **Adaptive Physics-Informed System Modeling with Control (APSMC)** framework, which integrates stochastic subspace theory, Kalman-based optimal estimation, and physics-constrained proximal gradient optimization. APSMC formulates nonlinear dynamics into time-varying state-space models, allowing real-time system identification from sparse and noisy measurements.

The framework is validated across:
- A **Duffing oscillator** under periodic forcing
- A **multi-degree-of-freedom frame** subjected to seismic excitation
- A **scaled bridge model** tested experimentally

It achieves low error (minimum NMSE of 0.398%) in predicting long-horizon responses from short initial segments, making it suitable for digital twin modeling, structural health monitoring, and real-time control.
