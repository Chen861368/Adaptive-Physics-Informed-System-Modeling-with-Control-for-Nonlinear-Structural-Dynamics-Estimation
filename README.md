## üîç Framework Overview

The figure below illustrates the core workflow of the APSMC framework proposed in the paper. This framework reformulates nonlinear structural dynamics into a time-varying state-space model via local Jacobian linearization. The learned system matrices‚Äîestimated through physics-constrained online optimization‚Äîare shown to be theoretically equivalent to the Jacobian matrices of the underlying nonlinear system:

## üìÑ Paper Abstract

Accurately capturing the nonlinear dynamic behavior of structures remains a significant challenge in mechanics and engineering. Traditional physics-based models 
and data-driven approaches often struggle to simultaneously ensure model interpretability, noise robustness, and estimation optimality. To address this issue, this 
paper proposes an Adaptive Physics-Informed System Modeling with Control (APSMC) framework. 
By integrating Kalman filter-based state estimation with physics-constrained 
proximal gradient optimization, the framework adaptively updates time-varying state-space model parameters while processing real-time input‚Äìoutput data under white noise 
disturbances. 

Theoretically, this process is equivalent to real-time tracking of the Jacobian matrix of a nonlinear dynamical system.
Within this framework, we leverage the theoretical foundation of stochastic subspace identification to demonstrate that, as observational data accumulates, the 
APSMC algorithm yields state-space model estimates that converge to the theoretically optimal solution. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated 
through numerical simulations of a Duffing oscillator and the seismic response of a frame structure, as well as experimental tests on a scaled bridge model. 

Experimental results show that, under noisy conditions, APSMC successfully predicts 19 consecutive 10-second time series using only a single initial 10-second 
segment for model updating, achieving a minimum normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 0.398\%. These findings demonstrate that the APSMC framework not only 
offers superior online identification and denoising performance but also provides a reliable foundation for downstream applications such as structural health 
monitoring, real-time control, adaptive filtering, and system identification.
